AIM : To write a program in ‘C’ to perform linear convolution 
between two discrete time sequences and verify the output 
using TMS320C6713 DSK. 
APPARATUS : TMS320C6713DSK(DSP Starter Kit), USB & Power cables. 
ALGORITHM : Convolution of two signals is defined as y (n) =x (n)*h (n) 
 =∑ x (k)*h (n-k), upper limit=∞, lower limit =0. 
1.Get the input sequence x(n) 
2.Get theimpulse response sequence h(n) 
3.Convolve the both sequence by making use of equation given 
above for y(n). 
PROGRAM : #include<stdio.h> 
#include<math.h> 
inty[20]; 
main() 
{ 
int m=6; /*Lenght of i/p samples sequence*/ 
int n=6; /*Lenght of impulse response Co-efficients */ 
inti=0,j; 
intx[15]={1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,0,0,0,0}; /*Input Signal Samples*/ 
inth[15]={1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,0,0,0,0}; /*Impulse Response Coefficients*/ 
for(i=0;i<m+n-1;i++) 
{ 
y[i]=0; 
for(j=0;j<=i;j++) 
y[i]+=x[j]*h[i-j]; 
} 
printf("Linear Convolution\n"); 
for(i=0;i<m+n-1;i++) 
printf("%d\n",y[i]); 
} 
EXPECTED OUTPUT: y=1 4 10 20 35 56 70 76 73 60 36 
RESULT:A non-real time ‘C’ program is written and and implemented using DSP 
 kit to find the Linear convolution between two sequences
